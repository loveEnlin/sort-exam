# Comparison of [Comparison sorts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_sort "Wikipedia").

## ABOUT THE RESEARCH

### Background

A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list elements through a single abstract comparison operation that determines which of two elements should occur first in the final sorted list. This kind of sort algorithms is used widely.And different ones have a major difference in [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity "Wikipedia").

### Target

Find out the exact time complexity of six kinds of comparison sort methods below instead of pure theory.
